Aegis Audit Project - AI Studio Context
Project Goal: To build the "Aegis Audit" application, a React/TypeScript PWA, based on the provided RFP and Technical Annex. The application is developed in a containerized Docker environment.
GitHub Repository (Private): https://github.com/alyousify1987/aegis-audit
Current Status & Accomplishments:
Environment Setup (Complete):
Professional development environment has been established using Git, VS Code, and Docker.
All critical environment bugs (HMR, WSL issues) have been resolved.
Project has been successfully pushed to a private GitHub repository.
Architectural Refactor (Complete):
The application's state management has been refactored to use Zustand as a central store, in compliance with the Technical Annex.
Separate, modular stores have been created for user, document, audit, ncr, and kpi.
All major Hub components now read their data from these central stores instead of managing local state.
UI/UX Polish (Complete):
The application's theme has been updated to use the correct Poppins and Inter fonts.
The UI layout has been improved with Paper components for better visual hierarchy.
The Analytics Dashboard charts have been polished to be more professional and handle empty/skewed data gracefully.
All known bugs, errors, and warnings have been resolved.
Feature Development (In Progress):
Document Control Hub: Considered feature-complete. It has a working "Add New Document" modal form and a functional search/filter UI.
Audit Management Hub: In progress. We are about to implement the "Plan New Audit" feature.
Agreed-Upon Next Step:
The next task is to implement the "Plan New Audit" feature. This requires two steps:
Update the existing src/components/AddAuditModal.tsx file with the full, functional code for the audit form.
Update the existing src/components/AuditManagementHub.tsx file to connect the "Plan New Audit" button to this modal.
